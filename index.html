      <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> some preferences and cached data may be stored on your device for offline use and faster performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics and crash reporting services:</strong> aggregated or pseudonymized insights to improve stability and user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud services:</strong> if you opt to sync or back up data, your entries may be stored with our cloud provider under contractual safeguards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="how-we-use">2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the Service, including saving entries, budgets, and generating summaries and trends.</li>

    <h2 id="legal-bases">3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the EEA or UK, we process personal data under the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to deliver the Service you request.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to maintain and improve the Service, secure it, prevent abuse, and understand usage, balanced against your rights.</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information</strong>, and we do not “share” it for cross-context behavioral advertising as defined by U.S. state privacy laws.</p>

    <h2 id="retention">5. Data Retention</h2>

    <h2 id="security">6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures (e.g., encryption in transit, hashed passwords) to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
